# Important-tools
These are important tools made by me for working with ORCA (a computational chemistry open source package) in a super-computing environment. They include multiple job submission scripts (BASH), multiple job cancellation (BASH), job setup with different geometries (in python), data extraction (BASH), final optimized geometry extraction (BASH) and many other miscellaneous codes.
Please uncomment the first few for loops which goes over a number of files.
